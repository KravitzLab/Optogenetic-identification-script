# Optogenetic-identification-script

This page contains the dataset of the spike and laser timestamps from Kravitz, Owen and Kretizer's 2012 paper "Optogenetic identification of striatal projectino neuron substypes during in vivo recordings" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178332).

The code will analyze spike trains around laser pulses to determine if a cell is significantly activated by the laser, and therefore expresses an excitatory opsin, such as channelrhodopsin-2. It returns an excel sheet that simply identifies the activated cells.
