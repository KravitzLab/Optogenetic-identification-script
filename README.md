# Optogenetic-identification-script

This page contains the Matlab scripts from Kravitz, Owen and Kreitzer's 2012 paper, "Optogenetic identification of striatal projectino neuron substypes during in vivo recordings" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178332).

The code will analyze spike trains around laser pulses to determine if a cell is significantly activated by the laser, and therefore expresses an excitatory opsin, such as channelrhodopsin-2. It returns an excel sheet that simply identifies the activated cells. 

To use scripts: <br>
1. Download the .m files from the laser_shuffle_scripts directory<br>
2. Follow instructions in laser_shuffle_readme file. A sample data file is provided.
